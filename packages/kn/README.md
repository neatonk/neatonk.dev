# kn

A React component package that provides the "KN" logo as an SVG component. The logo is generated from a bitmap sketch using a Python-based pipeline, ensuring the logo remains editable and maintainable.

## Features

- Clean, scalable SVG logo component
- TypeScript support with proper React types
- Python-based pipeline for converting bitmap sketches to SVG
- TypeScript-based component generation from SVG
- Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation support for Turborepo monorepos

## Usage

```tsx
import { Logo } from "@repo/kn";

function App() {
  return <Logo className="w-8 h-8" />;
}
```

## Development

The package is part of a Turborepo monorepo and uses pnpm for package management. It's configured as a Just-in-Time (JIT) package, meaning the TypeScript files are consumed directly by the consuming application (e.g., Next.js) without an additional build step.

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Generate the svg and react component
pnpm run build

# Cleanup the generated files
pnpm run clean
```

### Build Process

The build process consists of two main steps:

1. Converting the bitmap sketch to SVG using Python
2. Generating the React component from the SVG using TypeScript

These steps are automated through the package scripts and can be run individually:

```bash
# Convert bitmap to SVG using Python
pnpm run build:svg

# Generate React component from SVG
pnpm run build:component
```

## Logo Generation Pipeline

The logo is generated from a bitmap sketch using a Python-based pipeline, followed by TypeScript-based component generation. This setup allows the logo generation process to be easily tweaked and updated automatically as needed.

### How it works

1. **Python Processing**:

   - Takes a hand-drawn or bitmap image of the "KN" letters (e.g., `kn.png`)
   - Uses Python with image processing libraries to:
     - Convert the image to grayscale
     - Apply thresholding
     - Trace contours
     - Simplify paths
   - Outputs a clean SVG path suitable for use as a logo

2. **TypeScript Component Generation**:
   - Takes the generated SVG file
   - Uses TypeScript to:
     - Parse the SVG path data
     - Generate a React component with proper TypeScript types
     - Add React-specific props and styling support
   - Outputs a fully typed React component in `index.tsx`

### Configuration

- `kn.png`: The input bitmap sketch of the "KN" letters
- `kn.svg`: The output SVG logo generated by the Python pipeline
- `main.py`: Python script that handles the SVG generation
- `scripts/generate-component.ts`: TypeScript code that generates the React component from the SVG

### Troubleshooting

- If the output SVG is not clean, try adjusting the threshold or decimation factor in the Python script
- Ensure the input image is a clear, well-drawn sketch of the "KN" letters
- Check the Python script logs for any processing errors
- If the component generation fails, check the TypeScript script logs for parsing errors

## Technical Details

This package is configured as a Just-in-Time (JIT) package in the Turborepo monorepo. This means:

- TypeScript files are consumed directly by the consuming application
- No separate build step is required for the TypeScript files
- The package is optimized for use with modern bundlers like Next.js
- TypeScript compilation is handled by the consuming application

The generation pipeline (Python SVG generation and TypeScript component generation) is separate from the JIT compilation process and is only used to create the initial SVG and React component from the bitmap sketch.
